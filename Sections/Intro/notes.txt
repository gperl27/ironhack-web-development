Git -- Development

Made by Linus Torvalds (aka Linux guy also)


Github -- Like social media; houses repos
	Pros:   Good Terms of Service
		Don't need to know code

Adding remote:

$ git remote add origin https://github.com/username/myproject.git

When cloning, don't need to $ git init


$ git rm-f

deletes a file from the local folder
ex: $ git rm color.css -f

start tracking a file:
$ git add <file>

untrack a file:
$ git rm <file> --cached 
cached means it is NOT tracking
will still be in local file

$ git add .
adds all UNTRACKED files

git pull
Downloads all commits in the remote repo & adds them to local repo
